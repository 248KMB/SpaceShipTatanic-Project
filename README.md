# SpaceShipTatanic
This is my Data Science Project where I do research on a given project in this case, predicting who and how many people survived the space incident.
I was the algorithm developer who integrated countless supervised machine-learning algorithms and add-ons to ensure the most accurate result possible. To use these types of algorithms I use transformed CSV files from excel files.
